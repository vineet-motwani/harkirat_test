We have two arrays of strings, dictionary and queryString. 
For each string in queryString, find the string in dictionary that has the longest postfix that is same in both the query string and the string in dictionary. 
If there are more than one matches with the same length of postfix, choose the shortest string. 
If there are still ties, select the string that appears first in dictionary.

Return an array of numbers where each number is the index of the best matching string from dictionary for each query in queryString.

Note : A postfix is a substring of a string which atleast contains the last character of the string.
